# Cyber Journey: Foundations - Week 1 (Day 1)

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey into cybersecurity and system administration, starting with foundational knowledge about operating systems and kernel internals.

## Day 1: OS Basics & Kernel Lab

### What I Learned
- The kernel is the core component of an operating system, managing hardware, memory, and processes.
- The `/proc` filesystem provides live, real-time insights into system status.
- Essential Linux commands like `ps`, `top`, `df`, and `dmesg` help monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.

### Commands Explored
- `uname -r`: Displays kernel version
- `cat /proc/version`: Full kernel build information
- `dmesg`: Kernel and system messages
- `ps aux`: List running processes
- `top`: Interactive process monitoring
- `free -h`: Memory usage
- `df -h`: Disk space usage
- `lsblk`: Block devices
- `mount`: Mounted filesystems

## How to Use This Repo

- Browse the `foundations/week1/os_basics.md` file to see my notes, command outputs, and reflections.
- I recommend beginners run these commands on their Linux VM to get hands-on experience.
- Screenshots (if included) are in the `screenshots/` folder for visual reference.

## Next Steps

I plan to continue this journey with Windows CLI tools, PowerShell scripting, and cybersecurity fundamentals in upcoming weeks.
