# üñ•Ô∏è Day 1 ‚Äî OS Basics & Kernel Lab

## üìö What I Learned

- The **kernel** is the core of the operating system. It manages memory, processes, and hardware communication.
- `/proc` is a special virtual directory that gives a live view into how the system is running.
- Tools like `top`, `ps`, `df`, and `dmesg` help investigate performance, problems, and attacks.

## üîß Terminal Commands I Ran

```bash
uname -r                # Show kernel version
cat /proc/version       # Full system build info
dmesg | tail            # Last kernel messages
ps aux | head -n 10     # Show running processes
top                     # Real-time process monitor
free -h                 # RAM usage
df -h                   # Disk usage
mount                   # Mounted filesystems
lsblk                   # Block devices
ls -lah /               # Root directory listing
ls /proc                # Show /proc contents
cat /proc/cpuinfo       # CPU info
cat /proc/meminfo       # Memory details
